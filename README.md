This is a project that is based on the traditional sliding 8 puzzle game. Users will typically slide the numbers 1-8 around a 3 by 3 grid until the grid is ordered and reads {{1,2,3}{4,5,6}{7,8, }}. This version is focused on slicing an image and reordering the image until it looks like the original. It is also clickable and n by n meaning the amount of sub images can be increased according to the user's preference.
